# 16bit_SAP_LogiSIM
This is a 16bit Simple as Possible chipset designed in LogiSIM that has 3 registers, addition of ints, conditional jumps, sub-routines, multiply and divide functions, stack and a simple output. The project also has a simple lexer and assembler that converts a python-like syntax into instructions for the RAM and stores them in a binary file.
